# Predator RF — Operator Guide

**The single document. If the prior operator is unavailable, this is everything you need to pick the system up cold and conquer with it.**

This guide is exhaustive on purpose. The minimum-kit and first-day workflows are at the top so you can be live in 30 minutes; the deep architectural sections at the back so you can run the full multi-node TOC, geolocate emitters with TDOA, push to ATAK, and run a clean mission lifecycle without prior context.

## 1. What this is, in one paragraph

Predator RF is a phone-first software-defined-radio cockpit for a single SIGINT operator. You plug a USB SDR into an Android phone (or a Linux box), point an antenna at the world, and the app shows you what's transmitting in real time — frequency, power, GPS-stamped location, and whether you've seen it before. It records baselines so the next sweep flags only what's *new* in the area, automates band scans with target/exclude lists, links to other phones or Raspberry Pi sensors as a private fleet (Kujhad), geolocates emitters by **time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA)** when you have ≥2 GPS-synchronized nodes, decodes P25 / RTL433 / POCSAG / ADS-B / AIS, and pushes selected hits to ATAK / TAK as Cursor-on-Target chat alerts. The whole system is **RX-only** — no transmit surface anywhere. There are explicit two-key gates on every output (CoT, AutoTasker re-tunes) so an automated assessment cannot bypass operator intent. Built on the SDR++ core. Sideloads as an APK; the Python backend ships as a systemd service.

---

## 2. Two deployment paths (you can run one or both)

### Path 1 — Phone (Android)
The C++ Predator RF app on a Galaxy S22 (or any Android 10+ device), driving a USB-C SDR through an OTG cable. Standalone — no other infrastructure needed. The phone IS the cockpit. Optionally peers with other phones / RPi sensors via Kujhad over WiFi or a private overlay (ZeroTier / Tailscale).

### Path 2 — Linux TOC + RPi sensor nodes (Python backend)
A Python backend service (`predator-rf.service`) runs on a Linux operator workstation or a Raspberry Pi. It:
- Owns persistence (SQLite mission ledger).
- Aggregates events from one or more Kujhad-equipped C++ sensor nodes (phones, RPi-with-SDR, etc.) via the Kujhad HTTP API.
- Runs the TDOA coordinator, decision engine, AutoTasker, and CoT emitter centrally.
- Exposes a REST + SSE API on `:8000` (token-protected) for any UI/dashboard or for other Predator-RF backends to chain through (CoC mode — Center of Control).

The two paths are designed to be **mixed**. A typical mission has one Linux workstation running the backend + ATAK plumbing, three phones in the field with the Android app each sharing their picture into Kujhad, and one or two RPi sensors dropped at fixed points for unattended overwatch. All of that fuses into one operator screen.

---

## 3. Minimum kit (you need ALL of these to do anything)

| Item | Why |
|---|---|
| Android phone, Android 10 (API 28) or newer | Runs the app |
| **USB-C OTG cable or adapter** (USB-C → USB-A female) | Connects the SDR |
| **A USB SDR** — RTL-SDR Blog v4 ($40) is the cheapest, HackRF One ($340) is the upgrade | The actual radio |
| **An antenna** — even the rubber-duck shipped with the SDR works | Without one you receive nothing |
| **The Predator RF APK** | Built from the GitHub repo on Windows, or supplied by your team |

That's it. No internet required after install. No subscription. No account.

A full tiered bill of materials (cheap → fleet) is in **§ 24**.

---

## 4. First-time install (sideload)

Predator RF is **not on the Play Store**. You sideload the APK.

1. On the phone: **Settings → About phone → tap "Build number" 7 times** until it says "Developer mode is ON".
2. **Settings → Developer options →** turn on **Install via USB** *and* **USB debugging**.
3. Get the APK onto the phone (USB cable from a computer, Google Drive, email — anything).
4. On the phone, open the file (Files app → Downloads → tap `app-debug.apk`).
5. When Android asks "Install unknown apps?" → **Allow** for whatever app you opened the APK from → **Install**.
6. Open **Predator RF**.

When the app first launches it will ask for these permissions — **grant all of them**:

- **Location** ("While using the app") → for the GPS-stamped hit map and TDOA participation
- **Storage / Files** → for saving baselines and exporting CSVs
- **USB device access** → pops up the first time you plug in your SDR; tap **Always allow for this device**

If you skip any of these the app still runs, but the matching feature goes dead-quiet (no map fix, no exports, no SDR).

---

## 5. Plug in the radio and start receiving

1. Connect your SDR to the phone with the USB-C OTG adapter. Antenna goes on the SDR.
2. The first plug-in pops a system dialog: **"Open Predator RF when this USB device is connected?"** — check the box and tap **OK**.
3. In the app, on the left rail tap the **source dropdown** (top-left, says `None` until a radio is selected) → pick `RTL-SDR`, `Airspy`, `HackRF`, etc. matching what you plugged in.
4. Tap **▶ Start Listening** (big button under the source dropdown).
5. The waterfall on the right starts scrolling. **You're live.**

If the waterfall stays black, see § 23 (Troubleshooting).

---

## 6. The eight tabs (left-side rail, top to bottom)

The whole app is organized into eight tabs. They're labeled by their 3- or 4-letter code on the rail.

| Code | Name | What it's for |
|---|---|---|
| **SPEC** | Spectrum | Live waterfall + tuner. Where you actually look at signals. |
| **HITS** | Hits & Events | Every signal the app has noticed, plus the running event log. |
| **NET** | Network | Catalog of known networks / talkgroups / aliases — your "rolodex of emitters." |
| **MAP** | Map | GPS-stamped hits on a map view, with TDOA fix dots, error ellipses, and node positions. |
| **MIS** | Mission Config | Mission mode (Manual / Classify / Scan / QuickScan), search bands, targets, excludes, dwell timing. |
| **KUJ** | Kujhad Fleet | Link this phone to other Predator RF phones / Raspberry Pi sensors over a network. |
| **SYS** | System | App settings — modules, themes, decoder bridges, ATAK/CoT, baseline comparison, TLS fingerprint. |
| **BASE** | Baseline | Record what the noise floor / normal traffic looks like, save it, then suppress it next time so only NEW signals fire as hits. |

---

## 7. Mission modes (set on the MIS tab)

| Mode | What it does | When to pick it |
|---|---|---|
| **Manual** | Direct operator tuning and marker ownership. Nothing automated. | Free recon, training, demonstration. |
| **Classify** | Keep manual control while idle resources watch the band — passive classification of whatever crosses the threshold. | When you're working a known signal but want background awareness. |
| **Scan** | Automated search and target workflow across all configured bands with full target/exclude logic. | The default field mode for a real op. |
| **QuickScan** | Rapid single-marker sweep for a quick check — no target persistence. | Walk into a new area, spend 60 s seeing what's hot, decide whether to stay. |

Mode is set per-node. In a fleet, the operator workstation typically runs **Scan** while remote sensors run **Scan** with their own band lists tuned to their physical position.

---

## 8. The five day-one workflows

### 8.1 Just look around (passive recon)

1. **SPEC** tab → set the source → ▶ Start Listening.
2. Drag the waterfall left/right to retune. Pinch to zoom the view bandwidth.
3. Tap a peak to drop a marker on it.
4. To name what you just found: tap the marker → **Assign Marker** → tap **"Tap to edit"** in the popup → type a label.

### 8.2 Mark a hit and send it to your team

1. With a marker on a signal, tap **Assign Marker** if it isn't already.
2. The marker becomes a **hit** — visible on the **HITS** tab.
3. To push to ATAK / TAK: **SYS** tab → **ATAK / CoT** section → enter your TAK server IP + port → **Enable CoT**. The hit appears on the ATAK map as a friendly contact at your phone's current GPS location plus a chat message with the freq + power.

### 8.3 Record a baseline so you only see NEW signals

The first time you set up in a new area, run a baseline so the app learns what's "normally here" (paging towers, nearby commercial radios, broadcast leakage). Then any signal NOT in the baseline is flagged as new.

1. **BASE** tab → **Frequency Ranges** → set Range Name, Start Hz, Stop Hz → **+ Add Range**. Repeat for each band you care about. (Tap **"From Current View"** to grab whatever the waterfall is showing.)
2. **Recording** section → set a filename (or leave blank for auto-naming) → tap **▶ START RECORDING** (green).
3. Let it run for at least 5 minutes (longer = better — 30 min for a thorough sweep).
4. **■ STOP RECORDING** → **Save to File**.
5. **SYS** tab → **Baseline Comparison** → load the file → enable **Scan against baseline**. Set a threshold (default 6 dB). Now only signals exceeding the baseline by that margin become hits.

### 8.4 Run an automated scan across multiple bands

1. **MIS** tab → **Mission Mode** → **Scan**.
2. **Search Bands** section → add the bands you want swept (Name + Start Hz + Stop Hz). Tap **+ Add Band**.
3. **Targets** section — frequencies you specifically want to flag as priority (optional).
4. **Excludes** section — frequencies to ignore (your own gear, known broadcast carriers).
5. **Dwell** + **QuickScan Delay** + **Duration** — defaults are sane. Increase dwell for weak intermittent signals.
6. Back to **SPEC** → **▶ Start Listening**. The app sweeps the bands and drops hits on the **HITS** tab as it finds them.

### 8.5 Link a second phone or RPi sensor

See § 11 (full Kujhad walkthrough). Two-minute version:
- On the device-to-be-published-from: **KUJ** → **Listen** section → set port + Device name + API key → toggle **Listen** on.
- On the operator phone: **KUJ** → **Add Peer** → enter Name, Host (IP), Port, API key. Toggle **Mirror peer spectrum** to view their waterfall.

---

## 9. Editing fields on a touchscreen

Every editable field works the same way:

1. Tap the field. A popup opens at the **top of the screen**, above the keyboard.
2. The keyboard slides up automatically.
3. Type. The popup is intentionally pinned high so the keyboard never covers it.
4. Tap **OK** (or hit Enter) to commit. **Cancel** to discard.

Letter input through some IMEs (composing keyboards) may not register inside the NativeActivity — if a popup goes blank when you type letters, switch the system keyboard to a non-composing one (e.g. Google Keyboard with autocorrect off) for the duration of the edit. Numeric input always works.

---

## 10. The status bar at the top

| Indicator | Color | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Thermal | Green / dim grey | Nominal |
|  | Orange | SoC heating up; expect frame drops |
|  | Red | Severe — back off (lower sample rate, get out of sun) |
| GPS | Green | Lock + age < 60 s |
|  | Yellow | Lock but ageing — TDOA will refuse this node soon |
|  | Red / dim | No lock — TDOA disabled, map fixes use last known position |
| Kujhad | Green | All peers connected |
|  | Yellow | Some peers down |
|  | Red | None reachable |
| CoT | Off / dim | Disabled |
|  | Green | Enabled, packets going out |
|  | Yellow | Enabled but stuck at the manual-approval queue |

---

## 11. Kujhad fleet — protocol, pairing, TLS pinning

### 11.1 What it is

Kujhad is the in-band peer protocol. Each Predator RF instance can run as a **Device** (publishes its state and event stream) and/or a **Controller** (connects to one or more Devices and mirrors their state). It's hub-and-spoke, not mesh — the operator picks who they want to see.

### 11.2 The wire protocol (v1)

Tiny HTTP/1.1 + JSON, single API key in the `X-Kujhad-Key` header on every request. Default port **41947** (the C++ side; the Python backend's Kujhad client defaults to port **5259** in the env-var schema — use the actual port the Device is listening on).

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /v1/identify` | Device name, version, role, hardware profile |
| `GET /v1/gps` | Current GPS fix |
| `GET /v1/state` | Mission mode, scan status, threshold, search bands, decoder roster |
| `GET /v1/events?since=N` | Hit / decoded-event stream since serial N |
| `GET /v1/timing` | Clock source (gpsdo/ntp/system), PPS lock, offset, drift, last-sync age |
| `POST /v1/command` | Issue a typed command — `tune`, `scan`, `mission`, `identify` |

Every endpoint returns 401 on missing / wrong key, 400 / 404 / 405 on malformed / unknown / wrong-method.

**Hard safety boundary:** any command in the `tx` class is rejected by the dispatcher. The whole module never opens a transmit path.

### 11.3 Make this device discoverable (publish)

On the device that will publish its picture:

1. **KUJ** tab → **Listen** section.
2. **Listen port** — leave at default (41947) unless you have a conflict.
3. **Device name** — short identifier (e.g. `alpha-truck`, `bravo-roof`).
4. **API key** — leave the auto-generated 32-hex-char key, or paste your own. **Whatever this is, you'll need to enter the same value on every Controller that pairs with this Device.**
5. **Advertise address** — usually leave blank; the app picks the best interface (ZeroTier > Tailscale > LAN > loopback).
6. Toggle **Listen** ON.

The KUJ tab now shows a green "Listening on `<addr>:<port>`" banner. Hand the address + port + API key to whoever needs to pair.

### 11.4 Pair to a peer (subscribe)

On the Controller (your operator phone or workstation):

1. **KUJ** tab → **Add Peer**.
2. **Name** — anything memorable.
3. **Host** — the publisher's IP.
4. **Port** — the publisher's listen port.
5. **API key** — must match the publisher byte-for-byte.
6. **TLS** — leave OFF unless you've armed TLS on the publisher (see § 11.5).
7. **Add peer**.

The peer appears in the list with a status dot. Toggle **Mirror peer spectrum** to view that peer's waterfall on your screen while still controlling your local SDR. Toggle **Mirror peer markers** to see their hits on your map.

### 11.5 TLS pinning (when the build has OpenSSL)

By default the Kujhad protocol is plain HTTP, designed to ride on a private overlay (ZeroTier / Tailscale) where the network itself is the trust boundary. If your build links OpenSSL (`KUJHAD_HAVE_OPENSSL`), you can wrap the listener in TLS with a self-signed certificate that the controller pins by **SHA-256 fingerprint** — same model as SSH host keys.

On the publisher:
1. **SYS** → **Kujhad TLS** → **Generate self-signed cert** (creates `kujhad_tls_cert.pem` + `kujhad_tls_key.pem` in the app data dir, 10-year validity, RSA-2048).
2. The dialog shows the SHA-256 fingerprint as colon-separated hex. **Write this down** and read it to the controller operator out-of-band (voice, paper, SMS — NOT the same network you're about to pair on).
3. Toggle **TLS enabled**.

When TLS is on, plain HTTP is locked to loopback only — non-loopback peers attempting plain HTTP are rejected at the listener so the API key never crosses the wire in the clear.

On the controller:
1. **KUJ** → **Add Peer** → toggle **TLS** → paste the fingerprint into the **Pinned fingerprint** field.
2. On first connect the actual peer cert is compared against the pinned value. Mismatch = abort, with a loud warning.

### 11.6 Python backend → Kujhad device

To have the Linux backend (Path 2) consume from a C++ Kujhad device, set `FLEET_NODES` in `/etc/predator-rf/predator-rf.env`:

```
FLEET_NODES=alpha@192.168.1.10:41947:<api_key>:hackrf,bravo@192.168.1.11:41947:<api_key2>:rtlsdr
```

Format per node: `node_id@host:port:api_key:hardware_code`. The backend will identify each node, mirror its state, poll events at 1 Hz, GPS at 1 Hz, full state every 5 s, timing telemetry every 30 s. If the device reports a different hardware code than what's configured, the backend logs a loud warning and trusts the device — operators do mis-configure FLEET_NODES.

### 11.7 Kujhad troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Peer red / never green | Network unreachable, port blocked, or API key mismatch | Ping the host; telnet the port; verify the key character-for-character |
| Peer green but no events | Mission mode is Manual on the peer | Change to Scan / Classify on the peer |
| 401 on every request | API key wrong | Re-copy the key |
| TLS handshake failure | Wrong fingerprint pinned, or peer cert was regenerated | Re-pin the new fingerprint after verifying out-of-band |
| Peer shows "hardware mismatch" warning | FLEET_NODES says `rtlsdr` but device reports `hackrf` | Update env; restart `predator-rf`; the backend always trusts the device |

---

## 12. Geolocation — TDOA, the error ellipse, what confidence actually means

### 12.1 What TDOA is

Time-Difference-of-Arrival multilateration. When ≥2 GPS-synchronized sensor nodes hear the **same emission**, the difference in their timestamps (multiplied by the speed of light) gives a hyperbolic locus. With ≥3 nodes the loci intersect at a position fix.

### 12.2 What you need for a fix

| Need | Why |
|---|---|
| ≥2 distinct sensor nodes | Two events from the same receiver carry no time-difference info |
| GPS lock on each participating node | Without a position you can't triangulate at all |
| GPS lock age < 60 s on each node (configurable: `GPS_MAX_AGE_S`) | A stale fix means the node moved — the math breaks silently |
| Each node's hearings inside a 5-second window of each other | TDOA assumes one transmission; older measurements are pruned |
| A common time reference | GPSDO/PPS-disciplined hardware → high trust; system-clock-only → low trust but still produces a fix |

The platform is **inclusive by policy**: any GPS-equipped node participates, even cheap RTL-SDRs without a GPSDO. Their timing trust just gets capped at 0.5 instead of the 0.98 a GPSDO+PPS HackRF gets, and the resulting fix's confidence is multiplied by that average. **A rough fix from 4 cheap nodes is still operationally useful** — it gives you a search area instead of nothing.

### 12.3 The math (for the operator who needs to argue with TOC)

- 2 distinct nodes → fall back to the midpoint of their positions, fixed `confidence = 0.3` (then scaled by timing trust).
- 3+ distinct nodes → iterative least-squares solve in a local ENU frame, 50 iterations; geometric `confidence = min(0.95, 0.5 + 0.1·N)` where N is the measurement count, then scaled by timing trust.
- **Timing trust** per node:
  - GPSDO + PPS lock + |offset| < 10 ms → 0.98
  - GPSDO + PPS lock → 0.90
  - GPSDO no PPS → 0.75
  - NTP + |offset| < 25 ms + sync < 60 s → 0.70
  - NTP + |offset| < 100 ms → 0.55
  - NTP worse → 0.40
  - System-clock only → 0.30
  - Any of the above with last-sync > 5 min → minus 0.20
- **Final fix confidence** = geometric_confidence × mean(timing_trust of participants).

### 12.4 The error ellipse on the map

Every TDOA fix is rendered with a 1σ error ellipse, not just a dot. **This is the difference between a 50-metre fix and a 5-kilometre search area**, and both look like the same dot without it.

- **Base radius** scales as `50 m + (1 - confidence) × 4950 m` — a high-confidence fix shrinks toward 50 m, a zero-confidence fix grows toward 5 km.
- **Eccentricity** comes from the geometry of your participating nodes: tightly-clustered nodes give a near-circular blob, nodes strung along a line give a long thin ellipse perpendicular to the baseline (TDOA's actual physics — error is across the baseline, not along it).
- **Rotation** is the principal axis of the node cluster, rotated 90°, so the ellipse rotates with your fleet's actual geometry.

This is approximate (NOT Cramér-Rao-bound rigorous) but operationally correct. The operator immediately sees whether the system is confident in a position or merely confident there's *something* somewhere in a few-kilometre area.

### 12.5 What "confidence" actually means in three places

The word "confidence" appears on three different things — keep them distinct:

| Where | What it is |
|---|---|
| `track.confidence` on the HITS row | Detection / classification confidence — how sure the system is that this is a real, persistent emitter (not a one-shot artifact). 0.1 at first sighting, climbs with corroborating observations. |
| `track.location_confidence` (drives the ellipse) | Geolocation confidence — TDOA fix quality only. Independent of the detection confidence. |
| `assessment.confidence` on the threat assessment | The intelligence layer's confidence in its threat *assessment* (not the detection or the location). |

A track can have high detection confidence (0.9 — definitely real), low location confidence (0.2 — five-km search area), and medium assessment confidence (0.5 — probably elevated threat but not certain). All three are surfaced.

### 12.6 What happens with no GPS-synced nodes (single-phone operator)

If you have only one phone in the field, **TDOA does not run** — it physically can't, you need ≥2 GPS-synced sensors hearing the same emission within a 5 s window. Instead, the system has two fallback behaviours:

**Default (RSSI proximity disabled — `RSSI_PROXIMITY_ENABLED=false`):**

- The track's `estimated_lat / estimated_lon` stay `None`. Tracks have no map position of their own.
- The map shows your phone's GPS dot and its breadcrumb trail, with hit timestamps along the trail. **The operator does the triangulation in their head** by walking the area and noticing where the signal got stronger.
- This is the honest default: the system never *invents* an emitter position when it can't measure one.
- The CoT emitter (§ 16), if armed, falls back to **the detecting node's GPS** as a stand-in point so TAK has something to render — but that beacon means "I'm here and I heard something," not "the emitter is here." TAK shows it as a marker at your phone's location.

**Opt-in (RSSI proximity enabled — `RSSI_PROXIMITY_ENABLED=true`):** see § 12.7.

### 12.7 RSSI proximity fallback (single-node coarse geolocation)

When you set `RSSI_PROXIMITY_ENABLED=true`, single-node tracks get a coarse position estimate so the map shows *something* per emitter instead of just your phone's dot. **It is NOT a real geolocation. Treat the radius as a search area, not a position.**

#### How it works

- The detected signal's power (`power_dbfs`) is converted to absolute power at the antenna using a fixed offset (`RSSI_DBFS_TO_DBM_OFFSET`, default −30 dB).
- A **free-space path-loss** model converts that received power into a range estimate, given an **assumed transmitter EIRP** (`RSSI_ASSUMED_EIRP_DBM`, default 30 dBm = 1 W = typical handheld).
  - Formula: `d_m = (c / (4π·f_Hz)) · 10^((Pt_dBm − Pr_dBm) / 20)`
- The estimated range is multiplied by `RSSI_RADIUS_UNCERTAINTY_FACTOR` (default 2.0) to get the rendered circle radius — accounting for path-loss model error, EIRP guess error, and multipath.
- The radius is clamped to `[RSSI_MIN_RADIUS_M, RSSI_MAX_RADIUS_M]` (default 50 m to 5 km — same scale as a TDOA ellipse).
- The **circle is centred on the detecting node's GPS position**. There's no bearing information, so the emitter is "somewhere within radius `r` of your phone, in some unknown direction."
- `location_method = "rssi_proximity"` is set on the track so the UI can render it differently from a TDOA fix (a wide light circle vs. a tight ellipse).
- `location_confidence` is **hard-capped at 0.20** regardless of signal strength — TX power is unknown, so the system can never be highly confident about distance.

#### What this is good for

- **Walking-the-perimeter recon.** As you walk closer to a strong source, the estimated range shrinks and the circle visibly contracts on the map. You DF visually by watching the circles update.
- **Coarse "is it within 100 m or within 5 km" bucketing** when planning where to position fixed sensors.
- **Giving TAK a non-trivial CE radius** so the marker doesn't pretend to be a sub-metre fix when it isn't.

#### What this is NOT good for

- **Reporting actual emitter coordinates** to higher echelons. The single-phone CoT beacon should be understood as "operator was here, heard X" — not "emitter at coordinates Y."
- **Anything where the assumed TX power is unlikely to match.** A 25 W mobile being assumed-as-1 W will read as ~5× too close; a 100 mW IoT being assumed-as-1 W will read as ~3× too far. **If you know the band's typical TX power, set `RSSI_ASSUMED_EIRP_DBM` accordingly per mission.**
- **Positions in heavy clutter / urban canyon.** Free-space path loss assumes line-of-sight. Real-world buildings, trees, and ground bounce make the actual range estimate optimistic — bump `RSSI_RADIUS_UNCERTAINTY_FACTOR` to 3 or 4 in those environments.

#### Override priority

TDOA always wins. As soon as a second GPS-synced node hears the same emitter and TDOA produces a fix, the track's `location_method` flips to `"tdoa"` and the proximity circle is replaced by the proper ellipse. Operator manual-location overrides (§ 18.3) win over both.

#### What happens if even the detecting node has no GPS

- Track stays without `estimated_lat / estimated_lon`.
- Fallback CoT beacon, if armed, uses the **most-trustworthy node's last-known position** — marked with a different icon to flag that the location is a fallback.

---

## 13. Track lifecycle — NEW → TRACKING → STABLE → COASTING → LOST

Every emitter the system commits to becomes a **track** with a state machine:

| State | Triggered by | Operator meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **NEW** | First detection | One sighting, not yet corroborated. Don't act on it alone. |
| **TRACKING** | ≥3 observations | The system believes this is real. Scoring is live. |
| **STABLE** | ≥10 observations | The emitter is well-characterised. AutoTasker may auto-task. |
| **COASTING** | Track aged out of last_seen window but within track_replay_window | "Was here, hasn't been heard in a while, expected to return." |
| **LOST** | Track aged out beyond replay window | Archived. Removed from the live picture. |

The state is on the HITS row and gates how the rest of the system acts. AutoTasker and CoT escalation are both more conservative on NEW tracks.

---

## 14. Trust model — node trust score, timing trust, sensitivity trust

Every sensor node carries a composite **trust score** in `[0.05, 0.98]`. The score multiplies the weight of that node's observations during fusion, so a flaky cheap node doesn't drag a high-quality fix.

```
operational    = base_trust × uptime_fraction × (1 - false_positive_rate)
multi_node     = multi_node_agreement × 0.2
hardware       = freq_stability × 0.3
              + sensitivity   × 0.3
              + timing        × 0.2
              + 0.2 (constant)
trust_score    = (operational + multi_node) × hardware
                 × (0.7 if thermal_throttling else 1.0)
```

| Component | What raises it | What lowers it |
|---|---|---|
| **base_trust** | Operator manually marks node as trusted | Default 0.6 |
| **uptime_fraction** | Node reachable continuously | Network drops, restarts |
| **false_positive_rate** | Few unconfirmed-by-other-nodes hits | High solo-hit rate |
| **multi_node_agreement** | Hearings corroborated by ≥1 other node | Solo observations |
| **freq_stability_trust** | GPSDO-disciplined LO (low PPM) | Stock RTL-SDR tuner (50 PPM) |
| **sensitivity_trust** | Low NF (Airspy R2 at 2.5 dB) | High NF (HackRF at 10 dB) |
| **timing_stability_trust** | GPSDO + PPS, low offset | NTP only, large offset, stale sync |

The hardware components are derived from the per-SDR capability table (§ 21).

## 15. The intelligence layer — anomaly flags → threat level → recommended action

Every track passes through `DecisionEngine.assess()` which combines anomaly flags + classification confidence + frequency-band context to produce an `AssessmentReport`:

| Threat level | When it fires | Recommended action |
|---|---|---|
| **unknown** | No flags AND confidence < 0.3 | `continue_monitoring` |
| **low** | At least one flag, low severity | `continue_monitoring` |
| **medium** | One high-severity flag OR ≥2 medium flags | `increase_dwell_time` |
| **high** | Two high-severity flags OR (one high + confidence ≥ 0.5) | `focus_all_nodes` (auto-tasks every TDOA-capable node to this freq) |
| **critical** | Any critical-severity flag | `alert_operator_immediately` (NEVER auto-actioned — operator pushes the button) |

Tracks at `high` or `critical` set `escalate_to_atak = true`, which is one of the two gates the CoT emitter checks (§ 16).

The frequency-band context labels each track with the regulatory band — Aviation, VHF Public Safety, Marine VHF, UHF Public Safety, ISM 433/915/2.4 GHz, GNSS. The label flows into the assessment summary so the operator sees "Emitter at 162.5500 MHz (Marine VHF)" instead of just the raw frequency.

---

## 16. ATAK / TAK CoT integration — two-key gate, manual approval queue

### 16.1 The two-key gate

Predator RF starts in **RX-only** posture. Two flags arm CoT:

1. `cot_enabled` (env var `COT_ENABLED=true`, or the toggle in **SYS → ATAK / CoT**) — operator-level kill switch.
2. The track's most recent assessment must have `escalate_to_atak = true` (set automatically for `high` or `critical` threat levels).

Both must be true for a packet to leave. Even an automated `critical` assessment cannot bypass the operator's `cot_enabled` flag.

### 16.2 The manual approval queue (third key for the field)

In the field, set `COT_REQUIRE_MANUAL_APPROVAL=true` (or the **Require manual approval** toggle in SYS). With this on, `escalate_to_atak` no longer auto-fires. Each escalation enqueues at `GET /api/v1/approvals` (or surfaces as a notification on the operator phone), and the operator has to explicitly **Approve** before the packet goes out. **Reject** drops it; **Expire** happens after 2 hours by default (`COT_APPROVAL_EXPIRY_S`).

This is the two-person-rule equivalent for a solo operator. A single false-positive can spam TOC otherwise.

### 16.3 What goes on the wire

CoT 2.0 XML over UDP, defaults to multicast `239.2.3.1:6969` (the TAK SA feed). For unicast to a TAK Server, override `COT_DEST_HOST` and `COT_DEST_PORT`.

| Field | What's in it |
|---|---|
| `type` | `a-u-G` (unknown ground unit) when there's a TDOA fix; `b-m-p-s-p-loc` (point of interest) when only a fallback location |
| `point lat / lon` | The TDOA fix, or the most-trustworthy node's GPS as fallback |
| `point ce` (circular error) | Scales 50 m (high confidence) → 5 km (zero confidence). TAK renders it as the circle around the marker. |
| `point hae / le` | 9 999 999 (unknown altitude) — the platform doesn't claim altitude info |
| `contact callsign` | `<COT_UID_PREFIX>-<emitter_id_first_8_chars>` |
| `remarks` | `PREDATOR-RF <THREAT> | <freq> MHz | obs=<n> | conf=<x> | <summary>` |
| `stale` | Default 5 min after emit (`COT_STALE_S`), then TAK fades the marker |
| `__group name="Cyan" role="Team Member"` | Renders as a friendly contact, not a hostile |

Per-emitter rate limit is **5 s** between beacons for the same emitter so a chatty source can't flood TOC.

### 16.4 Test the path before you go live

```
COT_ENABLED=true COT_DEST_HOST=<your TAK IP> COT_DEST_PORT=4242 \
  curl -X POST localhost:8000/api/v1/test/cot
```

The endpoint emits a synthetic beacon at your own GPS. If a marker appears in TAK within a few seconds you're wired correctly.

---

## 17. AutoTasker — the action loop and its three brakes

When a `high` assessment recommends `focus_all_nodes`, AutoTasker re-tunes every TDOA-capable node to the track's primary frequency by issuing `POST /v1/command {class:"tune", action:"set", args:{frequencyHz, vfo}}` to each Kujhad device.

`critical` assessments are never auto-actioned — operator pushes the button.

**Three brakes prevent runaway tasking:**

1. **Per-node rate limit** — 30 s between tunes per node by default (`AUTO_TASKER_MIN_INTERVAL_S`). Prevents a chatty emitter from thrashing one node.
2. **Already-tuned check** — skip the tune if the node is already within ±2 kHz of the requested centre frequency.
3. **Global per-fleet budget** — at most 30 tunes/min across the entire fleet by default (`AUTO_TASKER_GLOBAL_MAX_PER_MIN`). Sized for ~6 nodes worth of churn. Prevents an assessment-loop bug from thrashing every node simultaneously at 0200 in the field.

AutoTasker is **OFF by default** (`AUTO_TASKER_ENABLED=false`). Same rationale as CoT — re-tune commands modify the SDR posture, so opt-in.

---

## 18. Operator overrides — friendly list, blacklist, manual location

Three classes of override, all persistent across restarts:

### 18.1 Friendly list
Mark an emitter_id as own-force or known-benign (your team's GMRS handhelds, the local police scanner, your own backhaul). Effect:
- Suppresses AutoTasker tunes for that emitter
- Suppresses CoT escalation
- Tags the track `friendly` on the UI (different icon, different colour)

Always recoverable — un-friend in the same UI.

### 18.2 Frequency blacklist
Add `(start_hz, end_hz)` ranges that the SweepCoordinator must skip and the TrackManager must drop on ingest. Use cases:
- A noisy commercial broadcaster you don't want clogging the HITS list
- A known interferer (your own LO leakage)
- An off-limits band you have a regulatory obligation NOT to log (e.g. some emergency-services frequencies)

### 18.3 Manual location override
Operator supplies a manual lat/lon for an emitter_id (confirmed via DF gear or visual). Wins over any TDOA estimate until cleared. Confidence is pinned to 0.95 by default. The map ellipse shrinks accordingly.

All three live in the mission DB and rehydrate on restart. There is an audit row for every add/remove so AAR exports show exactly when an operator declared something friendly or moved it manually.

---

## 19. Mission lifecycle — start, run, end, export the AAR

The mission ledger groups everything (events, tracks, assessments, approvals, overrides) under a `mission_id` so you can say "show me everything from yesterday's drill" or hand over a tarball as the after-action package.

### 19.1 Start

From the operator workstation:

```
TOKEN=$(grep API_BEARER_TOKEN /etc/predator-rf/predator-rf.env | cut -d= -f2)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -X POST localhost:8000/api/v1/missions \
  -d '{"name":"OVERWATCH-20260315","operator":"K9-Actual"}'
```

Or from the phone: **MIS** tab → **Mission** section → **Start mission** → enter name → **Start**.

Starting a new mission auto-ends any in-flight one — no need to remember to close.

### 19.2 Active mission

```
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" localhost:8000/api/v1/missions/active
```

### 19.3 End

```
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -X POST localhost:8000/api/v1/missions/end
```

### 19.4 Export the after-action package

```
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -OJ \
  localhost:8000/api/v1/missions/<mission_id>/export
```

Bundles a JSONL tarball: every event, every track, every assessment, every approval (approved AND rejected), every override change. Time-stamped and self-contained for ingest into another tool.

---

## 20. Path 2: the Python backend (TOC workstation + RPi sensors)

### 20.1 Install (one-time)

On a Linux box (Debian / Ubuntu / Raspberry Pi OS):

```
sudo mkdir -p /opt/predator-rf /etc/predator-rf /var/lib/predator-rf/backups
sudo git clone <repo> /opt/predator-rf
cd /opt/predator-rf
sudo python3 -m venv venv
sudo venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
sudo cp deploy/predator-rf.env.example /etc/predator-rf/predator-rf.env
sudoedit /etc/predator-rf/predator-rf.env       # see § 20.3
sudo cp deploy/predator-rf.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now predator-rf
```

### 20.2 Where things live

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `/opt/predator-rf` | Source checkout + Python venv |
| `/etc/predator-rf/predator-rf.env` | All env-var config |
| `/var/lib/predator-rf/mission.db` | SQLite mission ledger |
| `/var/lib/predator-rf/backups/` | Snapshots from `deploy/backup_mission.sh` |
| `/etc/systemd/system/predator-rf.service` | systemd unit |
| `journalctl -u predator-rf -f` | Live log tail |

Backend listens on `:8000`. For TLS, terminate at nginx / Caddy / Traefik in front — the backend itself stays plain HTTP intentionally so it works behind any proxy.

```

### 20.5 RPi sensor node

A Raspberry Pi running the Predator RF C++ build (or a slimmed sensor-only variant) acts as a Kujhad **Device**. Drop it at a fixed point with:
- An SDR (RTL-SDR Blog v4 minimum, Airspy or HackRF preferred for sensitivity)
- A GPS HAT or USB GPS (Adafruit Ultimate GPS HAT, BU-353N5)
- Power (PoE injector or 12 V → USB-C PD)
- Networking (Ethernet preferred; ZeroTier / Tailscale daemon installed for off-LAN reach)
- An antenna mounted as high as your mast allows

Configure its Kujhad **Listen** address + port + API key. Add it to `FLEET_NODES` on the operator workstation. Done — the operator now sees its picture.

### 20.6 CoC mode (Center of Control — TOC of TOCs)

Set `COC_MODE_ENABLED=true` + `COC_UPSTREAM_URLS=http://station-alpha:8000,http://station-bravo:8000` and this backend additionally consumes events from those upstream backends' `/api/v1/events/stream` SSE feed. Every aggregated event is tagged with `_upstream` so you know which station originated it, and `CrossStationDedup` coalesces tracks where freq + location agree (default tolerances: ±5 kHz, ±500 m, ±30 s co-occurrence). Two purely-local tracks never get merged here — that's `TrackAssociator`'s job.

---

## 21. Hardware capability table (every supported SDR)

These drive the trust calculus. Pick your hardware knowing what trust score you'll get.

| SDR | Freq range | Max sample | NF | MDS | TDOA-cap | Timing uncertainty | Price |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **RTL-SDR Blog v4** | 25 MHz–1.7 GHz | 3.2 MS/s | 6.0 dB | -110 dBm | NO | 1000 ns | $40 |
| **HackRF One** | 1 MHz–6 GHz | 20 MS/s | 10.0 dB | -100 dBm | YES | 500 ns | $300 |
| **Airspy R2** | 24 MHz–1.7 GHz | 20 MS/s | 2.5 dB | -125 dBm | YES | 50 ns | $170 |
| **LimeSDR-USB** | 100 kHz–3.8 GHz | 61.4 MS/s | 3.0 dB | -120 dBm | YES (PPS out) | 100 ns | $600 |
| **bladeRF 2.0** | 47 MHz–6 GHz | 61.4 MS/s | 4.0 dB | -118 dBm | YES | 80 ns | $480 |
| **ADALM-PLUTO** | 325 MHz–3.8 GHz | 61.4 MS/s | 5.0 dB | -115 dBm | YES | 200 ns | $200 |
| **SoapySDR generic** | 1 MHz–6 GHz | 10 MS/s | 8.0 dB | -105 dBm | NO | 500 ns | varies |

Practical guidance:
- **For TDOA you want Airspy or LimeSDR.** Both have low timing uncertainty AND great sensitivity. LimeSDR's PPS output lets you discipline the LO from a GPSDO directly.
- **HackRF is the workhorse for HF coverage** — only SDR in the list that goes below 24 MHz. Acceptable for TDOA; not the best.
- **RTL-SDR Blog v4 is the cheap "I'm here too" node.** No TDOA timing path, so it gets the 0.5-cap timing trust. Still useful as a 4th observer to pull a fix's confidence up.
- **PlutoSDR is the budget TDOA node** — half the price of an Airspy with TDOA capability.

## 22. Field-day checklist (print this)

### Pre-departure (in shop / vehicle, with WAN)

- [ ] Phone(s) charged + power bank packed
- [ ] APK version verified — open app → SYS → check version against your team's current build
- [ ] SDR + antenna + USB-C OTG cable in the bag (one set per phone)
- [ ] At least one **baseline file** for the area you're going to (record ahead if possible)
- [ ] If using ATAK: TAK server reachable + credentials entered + a successful test beacon yesterday
- [ ] If using Kujhad fleet: peers added, all on the same overlay (ZeroTier / Tailscale / LAN), API keys match, TLS fingerprints pinned if TLS is on
- [ ] If running the Linux backend: `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y` on workstation + each RPi
- [ ] Mission DB backed up: `deploy/backup_mission.sh` to USB
- [ ] System time disciplined: `chronyc tracking` shows `Leap status : Normal`
- [ ] `/etc/predator-rf/predator-rf.env` reviewed; `FLEET_NODES` matches today's node serials
- [ ] `API_BEARER_TOKEN` rotated for this mission: `openssl rand -hex 32`
- [ ] CoT/TAK destination + UID prefix set ONLY if you intend to push to TOC
- [ ] `COT_REQUIRE_MANUAL_APPROVAL=true` if `COT_ENABLED=true` (two-key gate)
- [ ] `AUTO_TASKER_ENABLED` matches your ROE — leave OFF unless you're authorized to re-tune nodes

### On-site, before fleet power-on

- [ ] Each sensor node placed; antennas oriented; GPS sky-view confirmed
- [ ] Power budget sanity-checked (battery / vehicle alternator vs. node draw)
- [ ] Network reachable: `ping <node-ip>` from operator workstation
- [ ] Each node's clock disciplined (GPSDO PPS lock visible, or `chronyc tracking` green)

### Bring-up sequence

1. Power on all sensor nodes; wait 60 s for GPS lock + Kujhad ready
2. Operator workstation: `sudo systemctl start predator-rf`
3. `python deploy/preflight.py` → must report **GO**
4. `journalctl -u predator-rf -f` → no `ERROR` lines in the first 30 s
5. `curl http://localhost:8000/healthz` → `"status":"ok"`
6. `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" localhost:8000/api/v1/nodes` → every expected node listed, `gps_synchronized=true` on TDOA-capable ones
7. `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -X POST localhost:8000/api/v1/missions -d '{"name":"<callsign-YYYYMMDD>"}'`
8. On the operator phone: SPEC → ▶ Start. Verify waterfall + GPS green + KUJ green + CoT (if armed) green.

### In-mission checks (every 30 minutes)

- [ ] Glance at thermal indicator on each phone
- [ ] Glance at GPS lock on each phone
- [ ] `curl /metrics` → `predator_events_total` is climbing
- [ ] `curl /api/v1/android-pull?since_ns=0` → all nodes show `gps_lock=true` AND `gps_age_s < 60`
- [ ] No CoT approvals stuck > 5 min in `/api/v1/approvals` (operator backlog)
- [ ] Phone batteries > 20% — swap to power bank before 10%

### End of mission

1. Phones: MIS → mode back to Manual; HITS → export hits to CSV; BASE → save fresh baseline if recorded
2. Phones: ▶ Stop Listening → close app → unplug SDR
3. Workstation: `POST /api/v1/missions/end`
4. `GET /api/v1/missions/<id>/export` → save the AAR tarball
5. `deploy/backup_mission.sh` → USB

---

## 23. Troubleshooting (every symptom we've actually seen)

| Symptom | Most likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Waterfall is black after Start Listening | SDR not selected, or USB permission denied | Source dropdown → re-pick. Unplug + replug SDR → "Always allow" on dialog. |
| App says "device busy" | Another app (or previous Predator RF session) holds the SDR | Force-stop in Settings → Apps; unplug + replug |
| Touch feels unresponsive / wrong widget fires | Old build — fixed in the touch-passthrough + ID-stack patches | Update APK |
| Soft keyboard covers the input field | Old build — fixed by IME-inset clamp | Update APK |
| GPS never locks | Phone needs sky view; indoor/urban canyon = no fix | Step outside; wait 60 s |
| Letters don't appear when typing in popup | NativeActivity IME composing path | Switch to non-composing keyboard for the edit; numeric input always works |
| Kujhad peer red / disconnected | Network unreachable, port blocked, API keys differ | Ping the peer from a terminal app; verify keys character-for-character |
| Kujhad TLS handshake fails | Wrong fingerprint pinned, or cert was regenerated | Re-pin the new fingerprint (verify out-of-band first) |
| Kujhad peer green but no events | Peer is in Manual mission mode | Switch peer to Scan or Classify |
| ATAK marker never appears | Wrong server IP/port, or filtering by UID prefix on TAK server | Check TAK server logs; test with `curl -X POST /api/v1/test/cot` |
| ATAK markers stop coming | Approval queue is on and the operator hasn't approved | Check `GET /api/v1/approvals`; approve or disable manual approval |
| Phone hot, framerate drops | Thermal throttling | Get out of sun; reduce sample rate (SPEC → source settings); trust score drops 30% while throttled |
| App crashes on startup after install | APK was sideloaded over a different signing key | Uninstall completely (Settings → Apps → Predator RF → Uninstall), reinstall |
| TDOA fix never appears on map | < 2 GPS-synced nodes hearing the same emission within 5 s | Check `/api/v1/nodes` — at least 2 must show `gps_synchronized=true` and `gps_age_s < 60` |
| TDOA ellipse is huge (5 km) | Low-confidence fix — only 2 nodes, or all timing-trust-capped RTL-SDRs | Add more nodes; deploy at least one Airspy or HackRF with GPSDO |
| TDOA fix wildly off | One node's GPS is stale | `GET /api/v1/nodes` and check `gps_age_s` per node; the offending one will be > 60 s |
| AutoTasker not retuning | `AUTO_TASKER_ENABLED=false`, OR the global-budget brake is firing | Check env, then `/metrics` for `predator_autotasker_*` counters |
| AutoTasker retuning the wrong nodes | DecisionEngine recommends only TDOA-capable nodes for `high` threats | This is by design; mark known-good non-TDOA nodes as friendly to suppress |
| Backend won't start: `ERROR: address in use` | Another process owns :8000 | `lsof -i :8000`; kill or change `API_PORT` |
| Mission ledger growing huge | No prune | `deploy/backup_mission.sh` to archive; truncate per your retention policy |
| 401 on every API call | `API_BEARER_TOKEN` set but no header sent | Add `-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"` |

| **Track** | A fused, persistent identity for an emitter — unique by `(frequency, modulation, detecting_node_set)` |
| **TrackAssociator** | The fusion module that decides whether a new event belongs to an existing track or starts a new one |
| **VFO** | Variable Frequency Oscillator — in this app, one of two independent tuners |
